<h1>Hi everyone!</h1>
<p>First of all, thank you for visiting my webfolio.</p>
<p>This section is where I talk a bit about myself. Let's say I'm a box full of surprises.</p>
<p>So, I'm Jo√£o Pedro Vale (actually, my name is way longer than that, but let's keep it simple and call me JP), and I'm currently 28 years old (who knows if you'll be reading this in 2023 or in 10 years from now...).</p>
<p>I was born and raised in Portugal, and I used to study Law. I was on my way to becoming a lawyer, but it seems the wind of change had other plans for me, so I never finished my law degree.</p>
<p>Talking a bit about my life after my studies, after law school, I took a break and moved to England for a journey that lasted 3 years. To my fellow Brits, thank you for your warm welcome and for letting me use your underground to visit London (that thing is so fast!).</p>
<p>Well, after 3 years, Covid came, and I took the first flight home. Then, I spent 2 years working as an International Planning Manager, where I learned a lot about exportation and importation.</p>
<p>However, that wasn't the right job for me, so after those 2 years, I decided to join a Network Administrator course, which turned out to be one of the best decisions of my life. I had gone through many jobs and never felt like I knew anything or was good at any of them, but working in the tech field is something that gives me pleasure and fulfillment.</p>
<p>So, I've always been a tech nerd or geek. I love games, PCs, and I enjoy following updates on GPUs, CPUs, or any new tech. Yeah, we can say I'm a big geek, haha! I built my first desktop piece by piece at the age of 15 just to run Counter-Strike 1.6. After that, I knew I had something in me that wanted to know more about technology.</p>
<p>Since then, I have been a really tech enthusiast, and that love only keeps growing.</p>
<p>Well, there's a lot more I could tell you about myself, like how I love to produce music, how I played in a CS Qualifier for an international event, or even how I grew up in a house with 15 dogs and 9 cats (let's not ask why), but those stories are for later.</p>
<p>Don't forget that this "about me" section has been written by someone who is learning how to code HTML. So, if I can do it, you can do it too!</p>
<p>Just invest in yourself and don't give up! I'm always a message away to help you.</p>
<p>Have a lovely and wonderful day!</p>
<p>JP</p>
